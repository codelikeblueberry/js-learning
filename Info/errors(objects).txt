# while learning objects:

const jsuser = {
    name : "swatantra"
}

jsuser.fullname = `${this.name} yadav` 

console.log(jsuser)
OUTPUT
*/{
  name: 'swatantra',
  work: [Function (anonymous)],
  fullname: 'undefined yadav'
}/*
Doubt: why it is giving me this undefined?


Q.  why it is giving me false ?
const jsuser = {
    name: "swatantra"
}

console.log(Object.hasOwnProperty(jsuser, 'name'));


A.

The correct way to check if an object has a property is to use the "hasOwnProperty" method directly on the object, not on the Object class. 


The Object.hasOwnProperty() method is used on an instance of an object, 
not on the Object class itself.
