What is javascript?
Javascipt is a single threaded syncronus language which is
converted into mahine code line by line by node interpreter.

What happens when you run a javascript program?
A execution context is created which has two coloums
- MEMORY -CODE

What is undefined?
It is a placeholder for any value which is not yet declared in variable.

This is the js function please explain me how this is executed.
First of all the execution context is created,
Secondly in memory the vaiables will be created.
secondly it gives the values to varibales.
when Function is called, the Execution context is again created.

Q. when does the memory allocation happens? Is it during code execution or before code execution.

Q. Are the == & > or < work same in JS?
